# React Router Layout Demo

This project is a basic single-page application (SPA) built using **React** and **React Router v6+** to understand layout structures, nested routes, and routing logic.

## ðŸ“š What I Learned

- How to use **React Router** with nested routes
- How to build a **shared layout** using `<Outlet />`
- How to conditionally render different pages based on URL
- Organizing components into header, footer, and dynamic content sections
- Using `.gitignore` to avoid pushing unwanted files (e.g., node_modules)

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack

- React
- React Router v6
- Vite (for fast development)
- Basic CSS/inline styling

## ðŸš€ Routes Implemented

- `/` â†’ Home Page
- `/neet/online-coaching-class-11` â†’ Class 11 NEET Program
- `/neet/online-coaching-class-12` â†’ Class 12 NEET Program
- `*` â†’ Page Not Found (404)

## ðŸ’¡ Purpose

This is not a production-level project â€” it's a learning exercise to practice **React Router layout nesting**, building a **SPA**, and understanding how **dynamic routing** works in modern React apps.
